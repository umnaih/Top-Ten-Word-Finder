# Top-Ten-Word-Finder

Welcome to the Top Ten Word Finder! This project is designed to efficiently find the most frequently occurring words in a 
dataset using the best data structure and sorting algorithms.
This project was prepared for CMP2003 - Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)

# Features
- Two datasets provided: "PublicationsDataSet" and "stopwords"
- Use of open hashing (chaining) to store and retrieve data in linked lists
- O(1) insertion time in the best and average cases and O(n) in the worst case
- Use of heap sorting to determine the top ten words, with O(n*log(n)) complexity in the best, average, and worst cases
- Exclusion of stopwords from the final list of top ten words

# Project Details
- Designed to identify the most frequently occurring words in a dataset in the fastest running time
- Implements open hashing and heap sorting to achieve efficiency and superior complexity compared to other data structures and sorting algorithms
- Excludes stopwords from the final list of top ten words

# Getting Started
To get started with the Top Ten Word Finder.

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your preferred development environment.
-Run the program to find the top ten most frequently occurring words in the dataset.

We hope the Top Ten Word Finder helps you to quickly and efficiently identify the most commonly used words in a dataset.
